# Revature-Project-One
This is a basic servlet application which implements all CRUD principles to create a dynamic repository for recipes.

For this project we were given an open-ended prompt to create a front-end application with all CRUD properties while using servlets.

 

    Leveraged Hibernate for database persistence
    Used Jakarta Server Pages to create dynamic webpages
    Utilized Tomcat for servlet creation and management
    Created servlets to handle html POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT requests
    Managed a cloud-based database for persistence
    Managed project dependecies on the backend with Maven
    Used Hibernate ORM to manage database tables and relationships
    Utilized Azure SQL database to store objects
